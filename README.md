# OpenAxis
An early prototype application for viewing real-time and archived video from Axis network cameras.

# Disclaimer
This is an abandonned early prototype which was developed over one week. The main component of this project is an indexing script which was designed to allow the development of a video archive - this was necessary due to the illogical and convoluted structure of Axis' recording directories. The index uses MongoDB for fun.

# Features
- An experimental indexing script for Axis video files.
- Live camera monitoring (hardcoded).
